# RBC-LunchMoney

An integration application between RBC and LunchMoney.app

## Introduction

This tool takes Royal Bank of Canada account export CSVs, matches them to existing accounts in Lunchmoney, and automates the import process. This should make importing things into lunchmoney a relatively simple process; it is currently, not really that simple.

## Getting Started

If you want to use this integration, and you're on Mac/WSL/Linux, you can download the latest release from our releases.

>[!NOTE]
> I know the binary is huge (~100mb for a CLI app is ðŸ¤ª). Unfortunately [Bun's compiled binaries are huge](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables#minification). Hopefully it improves moving forward.
