# RBC-LunchMoney
An integration application between RBC and LunchMoney.app

## Introduction

This tool takes Royal Bank of Canada account export CSVs, matches them to existing accounts in Lunchmoney, and autoamtes the import process. This should make importing things into lunchmoney a relatively simple process; it is currently, not really that simple.
