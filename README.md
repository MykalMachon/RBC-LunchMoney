# RBC-LunchMoney

An integration application between RBC and LunchMoney.app

## Introduction

This tool takes Royal Bank of Canada account export CSVs, matches them to existing accounts in Lunchmoney, and automates the import process. This should make importing things into LunchMoney easy, given Plaid's terrible support for RBC accounts (despite [their partnership](https://plaid.com/blog/plaid-expands-presence-in-canada/) ðŸ˜”)

**Update**: [this article](https://www.reinvestwealth.com/post/plaid-and-rbc-pioneering-open-banking-and-fostering-innovation) claims the aforementioned Plaid x RBC API will go live in 2024 ðŸ¤ž

## Getting Started

If you want to use this tool to import RBC transactions into LunchMoney, and you're on a Mac/WSL/Linux box, you can [download the latest release from the releases page](https://github.com/MykalMachon/RBC-LunchMoney/releases).

From there, just run the binary and it should take you through the process step-by-step.

If you have any issues, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/MykalMachon/RBC-LunchMoney/issues).

> [!NOTE]
> I know the binary is huge (~100mb for a CLI app is ðŸ¤ª). Unfortunately [Bun's compiled binaries are huge](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables#minification).
